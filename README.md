# Advent of Code 2025

I might be the first person EVER to choose "Rust" as my language of choice for Advent of Code[^1]! 🤯

Credit to [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) which inspired a bit of a the runner design, alongside the F# runner I wrote [last year](https://github.com/fluxehub/AdventOfCode2024).

[^1]: No exotic langs or F# this year, sorry :/
